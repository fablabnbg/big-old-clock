# Big old clock

A clockface and hands made from plywood with a lasercutter and engraver.
This is usefull for announcing the start time of a show. 
No clockwork, you have to turn the hands manually.

Line color red is cutting. Line color black is marking only. 
Note that we fill the numbers and hands with lines, instead of letting the
lasercutter itself engrave an area. This way we control how the darkend areas
are textured.

The numbers have a circular infill pattern, which can produce nice shading on natural wood.
The hands have linear infill pattern, which could give them a burned look.
Antique in any case.
